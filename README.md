# Ctrl-F

Top 5 and most innovative hack project at Qhacks 2019. 

This project is a ctrl-f for videos. Using both speech processing and image-text detection, we are able to find timestamps within a video where a certain keyword appears. 

We made use of Google Cloud Vision, Watson speech to text and open source networks to train data received from the apis.
